### CPSC 120

* Lab #3:

Lab 3 was one of my three favorite labs that we had over the course of the semester. It was the first time we had to use mathematical equations within code. For example, when having to initialize a value to an equation that calculates the BMR of a man or woman.

* Lab #5:

Lab 5 was a very interesting lab in which we had to edit 4 different files. It was a very fun lab in which we had to calculate the area of a rectangle writing code that programs two integers as a command line argument. Another fun part of the lab was how we utilized code that was new at the time, inside the part-2 file in the lab.

* Lab #6:

My favorite lab out of all the labs we have done in CPSC 120L was Lab 6. Lab 6 was based off of blackjack which is one of my favorite card games. Because of this, it made the Lab twice as enjoyable despite running into many problems when creating functions to calculate values for each card or whether the player busted or not using boolean functions.
